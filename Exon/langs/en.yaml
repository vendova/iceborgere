   Sometimes, you promote or demote an admin manually, and NetworkModerator doesn't realise it immediately. This is because to avoid spamming telegram servers, admin status is cached locally.
   This means that you sometimes have to wait a few minutes for admin rights to update. If you want to update them immediately, you can use the /reload command; that'll force NetworkModerator to check who the admins are again.

welcome_mutes: |
    You can get the bot to mute new people who join your group and hence prevent spambots from flooding your group.  
    
    The following options are possible:
    - /welcomemute <code>soft</code>: Restricts new members from sending media for 24 hours.
    - /welcomemute `strong`: Mutes new members till they tap on a button, thereby verifying they're human.
    - /welcomemute `captcha`:  Mutes new members till they solve a button captcha, thereby verifying they're human.
    - /welcomemute `off`: Turns off welcomemute.
    
    *Note:* Strong mode kicks a user from the chat if they dont verify in 120seconds. They can always rejoin though.

welcome_help: |
    Your group's welcome/goodbye messages can be personalized in multiple ways. If you want the messages to be individually generated, like the default welcome message is, you can use *these* variables:
    
    - {first}: This represents the user's *first* name.
    - {last}: This represents the user's *last* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.
    - {fullname}: This represents the user's *full* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.
    - {username}: This represents the user's *username*. Defaults to a *mention* of the user's first name if has no username.
    - {mention}: This simply *mentions* a user - tagging them with their first name.
    - {id}: This represents the user's *id*
    - {count}: This represents the user's *member number*.
    - {chatname}: This represents the *current chat name*.

    Each variable MUST be surrounded by `{}` to be replaced.  
    Messages also support markdown, so you can make any elements bold/italic/code/links.
    Buttons are also supported, so you can make your welcomes look awesome with some nice intro buttons.

    To create a button linking to your rules, use this: `[Rules](buttonurl://t.me/{bot.username}?start=group_id)`. 
    Simply replace group_id with your group's id, which can be obtained via /id. Be sure to mention the bot's username after the t.me.

    You can even set images/gifs/videos/voice messages as the welcome message by 
    replying to the desired media, and calling /setwelcome.
